* Introduction

  This repository contains the code and the documentation for the EECS
  504 project (Winter 2018).

** Rationale

   In the drive towards increased vehicle autonomy, one hurdle is the
   detection and anticipation of pedestrians.  Of course, given the
   complex nature of human interaction with the environment,
   especially in cityscapes, we thought that studying the attention of
   people crossing the streets is paramount to building better self
   driving cars.  

   Now, if we can classify the most common mistakes that people make
   which will take away attention from the road (like appreciating
   those expensive shoes or chatting with your significant, probably
   soon to be widowed other), we essentially have more information at
   the autonomous vehicle to make a better call.

   While RCNN and its ilk
   cite:DBLP:journals/corr/RenHG015,DBLP:journals/corr/Girshick15,DBLP:journals/corr/GirshickDDM13
   can detect people well, intent is not known from the masks and
   that's an additional step that needs to be done.


   By using a pose estimator cite:DBLP:journals/corr/CaoSWS16,
   we can reduce the problem of pedestrian attention/awareness
   detection to one that works on classifying poses of skeletons.

   Another possible advantage of this approach (only envisioned, of
   course) is that we can generate synthetic data as we the pose
   machine already reduces the state space search to a much smaller
   domain (angles and their relative movements) and generating data
   for this domain should be a lot easier as well.
   

** Scope of this work.

   In this work, we restrict ourselves to the common patterns of
   distractions.  One of them is not looking at the ground and another
   is gazing into the deep, dark void of a smartphone.
   
   Also, we use the pose estimator from CMU
   cite:DBLP:journals/corr/CaoSWS16,simon2017hand to get the
   skeletons.  We then trained it on a minimal set of data we could
   acquire to train an ensemble of single class SVMs.  The data was
   essentially the angles between the different keypoints output by
   the previous stage.

   We classify single frames and not sequences in this work.

** Future work
   There are tons of ways to expand this.  I'm listing some of them
   and will add more as we go along.  Issues have been opened for all
   these.

   - [ ] Use tracking when a person is occluded (Particle filters) and
     their last movement was towards the road.
   - [ ] Use LSTMs to train what people are likely to do from a given
     action.
   - [ ] Generate synthetic data maybe using GANs or Unity3D?
   - [ ] Better metric for error.  
   - [ ] Replace SVMs with a single neural net and use it in training
     of the pose estimator.
   
** A brief introduction to the architecture

   - Get the pose estimate.
   - Get angles between the different skeletons.
   - Use the ensemble of single class SVMs to see if they fall in any
     of the dangerous categories.
     
   NOTE: Additionally, in the project implementation, we used Hough
   transforms to find the pavement and reduce the region of interest
   to only the road.  However, with further thought, it may be better
   to actually look at the entire region.


** SubModules

   The openpose library is used as a sub-module here.
